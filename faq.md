### 📝 Why the `.ns` extension?

Nu-lang uses the **`.ns`** extension (standing for **N**u **S**ource). This design choice was made to ensure a distinct identity and technical precision:

* **Zero Ambiguity**: It avoids conflict with **Nushell**, which already occupies the `.nu` extension in the Rust ecosystem.
* **No Country Code Conflict**: Unlike `.nu` (Niue) or `.nl` (Netherlands), **`.ns`** is an unassigned code in the ISO 3166-1 standard. It belongs to code, not geography.
* **Semantic Clarity**: The "S" represents **S**yntax and **S**ource, reflecting the language's focus on high-density structural expression.
